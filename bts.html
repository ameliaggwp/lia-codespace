<h2>LOVE YOURSELF結 'ANSWER'</h2>

<p>“Loving oneself is where true love begins”
  <br>A celebration with the ARMY
</p>
<p>
First unveiled in March of 2016, the BTS LOVE YOURSELF series creates a narrative by linking the key songs in each album into a single theme, imparting the message that “loving yourself is true love”. Like a well-written novel having introduction, development, twists, and conclusion it shared a compelling story for two and a half years.
<br><br>
‘ANSWER’ is the final piece of the puzzle. Though it’s a repackaged album, LOVE YOURSELF 結 ‘ANSWER’ still includes seven brand-new tracks. CD A is a concept album, its sixteen tracks all connected lyrically to highlight BTS’ prowess as both artists and storytellers.

<h2>LOVE YOURSELF轉 'TEAR'</h2>

<p>BTS releases third studio album LOVE YOURSELF 轉 ‘TEAR’
<br>Fake love inevitably leads to loss and separation,
<br>For true love can only begin when you learn to love yourself
<br>
</p>
<p>
BTS will release LOVE YOURSELF 轉 ‘TEAR’, their third studio album on May 18.
<br><br>
BTS’ LOVE YOURSELF series bears the message that loving oneself is the beginning of true love. Whereas the previously unveiled LOVE YOURSELF 起 ‘WONDER’ and LOVE YOURSELF 承 ‘HER’ albums expressed the heart-fluttering and tingling moments of love, LOVE YOURSELF 轉 ‘TEAR’ album embodies the pain of boys faced with parting.
